# Hi! I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate curious and eager in the intersection of biology and computer science. I have a strong background in the biological sciences with particular interest in bioinformatics. My journey in the STEM field has been driven by a love for understanding complex molecular pathways and finding solutions to challenging problems.

## ðŸ”¬ What I Do

- **Bioinformatics:** I enjoy diving into data and making sense of it through computational tools. Whether it's analyzing large datasets or learning how to code scripts to automate tasks, I'm always eager to combine biology with technology to motivate research.

- **Cancer Research:** One of my significant projects in school was studying mechanisms of cancer, particularly those driven by the RAS MAP Kinase pathway. My research aimed to uncover the ways these pathways contribute to cancer progression, but also their resistance to drugs and therapy, helping to pave the way for more effective treatment.

- **Molecular Biology:** I've done a lot of laboratory work, from basic wet lab techniques like bioassays to understanding protein expression and function. I have hands-on experience with techniques like qPCR, DNA purification, and immunoblotting.
  

## ðŸ“¸ Outside the Lab

When I'm not immersed in research, you'll likely find me dabbling in some photo and video editing. I love the  creativity involved in multimedia editing. I enjoy dancing and playing games as well.
